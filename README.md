# Ensemble Learning
This repository contains analytics frameworks for answering several real life analytics problems including: Drug Discovery, Shelf Space Optimization, Customer Filtering System, &amp; Monetization of User Data.

# Power Company 
The bottom-line question is which shutoffs should be done each month, given the capacity
constraints. One consideration is that some of the capacity – the workers’ time – is taken up by
travel, so maybe the shutoffs can be scheduled in a way that increases the number of them that
can be done. Not every shutoff is equal. Some shutoffs shouldn’t be done at all, because if the power is left
on, those people are likely to pay the bill eventually. How can you identify which shutoffs
should or shouldn’t be done? And among the ones to shut off, how should they be prioritized?

# Shelf Space Optimization
How much shelf space should the company have, to maximize their sales or their profit?
Of course, there are some restrictions – for each product type, the retailer imposed a minimum amount of
shelf space required, and a maximum amount that can be devoted; and of course, the physical size of
each store means there’s a total amount of shelf space that has to be used. But the key is the division of
that shelf space among the product types.

# Monetization of User Data
How could the company use these data sets to generate value, and what analytics models might they need to do it?
See attached datasets in MonetizationDatasets.

# Drug/Viral Targeting
\[REDACTED FOR PRIVACY], a public-private biotechnology company, uses historical and medical data, analytics and artificial intelligence to identify which virus families are most likely to cause major outbreaks of new viruses and develop new antiviral drugs before they are needed. When a new virus infects humans, our immune systems are powerless to stop it from replicating. Viruses in the same family share inherited methods for hijacking cells to essentially become virus factories (host-cell machinery essential for virus infection and replication). \[REDACTED FOR PRIVACY] scientists identify those common factors within virus families and exploit them as a viral Achilles heel.
